Welcome to WriteCD v 1.5!

To get the most out of this, you will need to do a couple of things. 

1.) Install cdr-tools, found on BeBits.
2.) Put a copy of Terminal in /boot/home/config/bin, or put a symlink to Terminal there
3.) Move the files in the "Stuff to move" folder to the dir it says to.
4.) You will need a CD-R/RW

This version has some major improvements.  You no longer need to edit the files to change the device.
You just run "Configure MakeCD" , and follow the easy instructions. If at any time you want to change those settings, just re-run  "Configure MakeCD".  

Everything else should be self explanatory....

Thanks to Brazilian and Kart and regurg in #bedev on efnet. These scripts wouldn't be here with out all the help these guys gave me. Thanks to Benux for giving me a kick in the pants, and Tika for providing lots of inspiration. 

Read http://www.betips.net/cgi-bin/chunga.pl?ID=tip389 for more info on the general theory behind this. If you still can't get things working, contact me. dykstraz@central.edu

Good luck, and happy burning.
