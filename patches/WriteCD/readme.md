## WriteCD

WriteCD (by Zach Dykstra) can be used to create, format, and write to CD-ROM on BeOS. The author of the original archive failed to include the MakeBFS program, which is needed by MakeCD to create BFS images and to write BFS formatted CDs. I wrote MakeBFS, added it to the original package, and then created this archive.

### Usage:

All of the files in the archive need to be copied to `/boot/home/config/bin`. After that, please create a hardfile link to `MakeCD` on the your desktop or in the folder of your choice. Finally, double-click on the `MakeCD` link to launch the `WriteCD` application.
