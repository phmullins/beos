### Enigma

This Enigma simulation (by Henry Tieman) can be used to encrypt and/or decrypt any file using the German Enigma Algorithm. I have more than a passing interest in Cryptography and ported Enigma so that BeOS users would have another choice when it came to encrypting their data.

### Installation

Copy the `enigma` file to `/boot/home/config/bin`.

### Usage:

Anyone know how to set up a valid Enigma keyfile? I tried testing this Enigma simulator, but It keeps crashing due to an invalid keyfile. Please contact me if you know anything about the Enigma cipher and how I might be able to finally make this implementation useful to the BeOS community.
