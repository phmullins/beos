### Wan-Krypt

Wan-Krypt (sounds like One-Crypt) is a program that implements an algorithm based on one-time pad encryption. The one-time pads are the only encryption method proven to be unbreakable so far. This Wan-Krypt implementation (by ALoR) can be used to encrypt and/or decrypt any file using the Wan-Krypt one-time pad Algorithm. I have more than a passing interest in Cryptography and ported Wan-Krypt so that BeOS users would have another choice when it came to encrypting their data.

### Installation

Copy the `wancrypt` file to `/boot/home/config/bin`. To Compile: gnumake wkrypt

### Usage:

It compiled without any warnings or errors. Please contact me if you know anything about this Wan-Krypt implementation and how I might be able to finally make this implementation useful to the BeOS community.

### Author
Wan-Krypt was created by Henry Tieman and ported to BeOS by [Patrick H. Mullins](http://www.pmullins.net) on July 3rd, 1999. You can find me on  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phmullins) and on [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) as @pmullins.
