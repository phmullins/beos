### Lucifer

This Lucifer implementation (by Jonathan M. Smith) can be used to encrypt and/or decrypt any file using the IBM Lucifer cipher. I have more than a passing interest in Cryptography and ported Lucifer so that BeOS users would have another choice when it came to encrypting their data.

### Installation

Copy the `lucifer` file to `/boot/home/config/bin`.

### Usage:

It compiled without any warnings or errors. Please contact me if you know anything about IBM's Lucifer cipher and how I might be able to finally make this implementation useful to the BeOS community.

### Author
